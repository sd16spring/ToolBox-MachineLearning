1. The general trend of the curve is positive correlation
2. There is more noise towards the two ends of the curve, probably because there is too much imbalance either way.
3. The graph is fairly smooth around 3000 trials
4. As C increases the graph becomes more of a curve than a line, appearing to hit some sort of asymptote.
