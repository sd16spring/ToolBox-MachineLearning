1. The general trend in the curve is that as you use a larger percentage of your data for training, you get better results in testing
This is because it has more time to 'learn' and it can generate more accurate factors for the test.
The curve could reasonable be approximated to a line, but it actually looks much more like a log

2. Some parts of the curve are noisier because the randomness for how it's broken up matters more for smaller values
For really small training sets you can get a set that is highly representative of handwriting or one that is much less representative

3. You my curve at 10 was distinctly not smooth, at 100 it was roughly not smooth, at 1000 it was very smooth
somewhere between 100 and 1000 you will get a smooth curve, but it's garunteed on the at 10^3 trials

4.C is the how accurate you want the model to be. At higher values it becomes more precise and at lower values the model is rougher.
