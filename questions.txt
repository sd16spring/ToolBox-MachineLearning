1. What is the general trend in the curve?
The accuracy of the test generally increases as the percentage of the data used to train the machine increases.

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?
The curve seems to be consistently noisy at 10 trials.

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
The curve started to smooth out at 2000 trials per percentage.

4. Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?  If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.
As C gets larger, the noise in the curve decreases.
