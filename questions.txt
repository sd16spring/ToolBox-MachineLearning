1. The general trend is upward.
2. The beginning and end of the curve appear to be noisiest. This is likely because testing and training both require a certain amount of data to work well, so when almost all the data is being used for one or the other the curve can get messed up.
3.The curve was pretty smooth around 5000 trials. A good way to smooth the curve even more at large numbers of trials was to change the step size in the percentages from 5 to 1.
4. Higher C values emphasize noise, and lower C values smooth.
