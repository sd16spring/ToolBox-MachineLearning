1. The general trend appears to be a negative exponential distribution.
This means that for lower train percentages, we will will have a high positive derivative.
As the train percentage increases, the derivative decreses.
See figure 500gTrials.png for actual plot.

2. Some parts of the graph are noiser than others.  In general, the graph increases noise until
train percentage = 30.  Then it decreases for the rest of percentages.
See 500TrialStandardDeviation.png to see a standard deviation.

3. 100 for smooth average.  500 for smooth-ish standard deviation

4. A higher c value makes the program much more accurate.  It also makes it take much longer.
I tried c = 1.  This lead to accuracies of 88-98 % for all splits.  It also took a long time
to train.  Standard deviations as a whole drastically went down.  The standard deviation curve also changed to something more like a parabola.
