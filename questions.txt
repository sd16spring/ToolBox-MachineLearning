The general trend of the curve is upward. It increases more rapidly over lower percentages of data used, and increases less rapidly over higher percentages of data used. 

The curve appears to have noise between 30-60 percent of data used fairly consistently. I think this may have to do with the amount of data available for learning when compared to the amount available for testing.

Around 100 trials are required for a decently smooth curve. Upwards of 400 trials give the curve a much smoother finish.

It appears that the C value of 10 smooths the curve out so that it increases in a more linear progression. A graph with a C value of 2 looks very logarithmic. It also starts with an accuracy around 0.82.
