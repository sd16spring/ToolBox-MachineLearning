1.) Upward; generally, the more of the data is used in training, the more accurate the results are.
2.) Yes, the smaller values. Less training data leads to more inconsistent results.
3.) At num_trials = 50, the curve seems pretty consistently smooth.
4.) At larger values of C, the calculations take significantly longer, but test accuracy increases more steeply with percentage of training data. It seems to asymptotically approach 90% accuracy. At smaller values, the calculations are fast, but the accuracy is terrible.
