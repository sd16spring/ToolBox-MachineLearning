1. The accuracy on test set was correlated to the percentage of data used for training.
2. The noisiest part of the graph seems to be the middle, ranging from 25 percent to 65 percent. The likely reason for this is there is a larger variation in results when the percentage of data used for training is not extreme. More trials would probably smooth out the curve and reduce noise.
3. Although there were always variations, the curve seemed to be a lot smoother when I did 25 tests instead of 10.
4. As C decreased, the accuracy got higher at lower percentage of data used for training.
