1. What is the general trend in the curve?

It seems inverse, and the bigger percent you use for training, the more accurate the results are.

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?

The first 1/2 (the middle part especially) seems way noisier than the end of the curve, where most of the set is used for training. 

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?

Well, I couldn't get a smooth curve, but by around 20 trials, you can see a clear trend in the graph that plots every trial.

4. Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?  If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.

The lower the value, the noisier the data is. A C value of 1 generates a pretty clean line, whereas a C value of 10^-20 shows wild variation in the trials.
