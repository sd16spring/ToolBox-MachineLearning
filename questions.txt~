1. Generally, as the percentage of data used increases, so does the accuracy on the test set.

2. It seemed to me that the whole curve appeared to be noisy, especially at a low number of trials. There didn't seem to be an area that was nosier than others.

4. As C gets larger, the graph becomes smoother, and as C gets smaller, the graph becomes very noisy.
